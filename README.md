Create a webpage that simulates a coin flip.

The page should have two buttons, one labeled "Heads" and the other labeled "Tails".

When either button is clicked, call a function that takes the guess (heads or tails) as an argument, generates a random number to represent the coin flip, then displays a message about the result of the flip.
